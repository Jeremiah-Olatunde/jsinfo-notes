# The modern mode, `"use strict"`
---

ECMAScript 5 introduced breaking changes to the JavaScript language. These changes are enabled by placing the `"use strict";` directive **at the top of the file** to enable strict mode. `"use strict";` can also be placed at the top of a function body to enable strict mode in that function only.

> [!note] Strict mode is automatically enabled when using ES5 specific features.

> [!warning] Strict mode is not enabled by default in browser consoles.
